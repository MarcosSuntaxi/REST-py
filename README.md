# Simple Flask Project

This is a simple Flask project where we demonstrate how to display tasks in a list using Flask. This project does **not implement REST API**, but simply shows a list of tasks on the main page.

## Project Structure


## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python 3 and the following dependencies:

- Flask

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
